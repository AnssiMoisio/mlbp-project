We chose Keras because of its popularity and documentation availability.\n",

However, data analysis is already quite ubiquitous and the need for better tools is ever-growing. Some people, who would benefit from machine learning and data analysis, might not even be aware of the current progress of the field nor the tools at all. If these people were made aware of the field it will overall benefit the society we live in. To this day, it still requires a data scientist/engineer to build the models because of the various bottlenecks present in data science. \n",

    "The supplied data contains 4363 labeled samples and 6544 unlabeled sample vectors. Every sample is a vector of length 264 which is composed of preprocessed properties of the original time-series data. There are 10 labels and the class distribution is unbalanced; almost half of the labeled samples have the same label which could lead to problems in classification. For example, we don't want the classifier to learn the class distribution of the training set because the class distribution might be completely different for the evaluation set. Some of the fields in the data contain almost identical values for the whole dataset which means these features cannot be used to differentiate samples. Some of the features may also be redundant and contribute nothing while having high variance amongst the dataset. "
